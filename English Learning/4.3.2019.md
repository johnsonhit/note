Do not reward poor service
   A tip should always go hand in hand with good service. There is no reason to reward poor service. Travelers should always feel free to withhold a tip with a clear conscience whenever they get a raw deal. On the other hand, tourists should not make outrageous demands that are impossible to meet.
   
   On a parting note, please make sure to tip the attendants in public bathrooms at train station, museums, and parks all over Europe. It is common practice there.
